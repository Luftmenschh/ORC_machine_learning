# ORC_machine_learning
（第一次在Github上提交代码很紧张） 一个研究方向为ORC（有机朗肯循环）的工科生，看paper的时候发现了一个用机器学习来预测ORC参数的大佬，借着大佬的思路试着做了一个小项目，请有相同方向或者兴趣的朋友们交流批评指正哇，数据是我在一个小机组上跑出来的，不太方便公开，大家如果有问题欢迎来交流~


An engineering student whose research direction is ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle), when I read the paper, I found a researcher who used machine learning to predict ORC parameters. I tried to make a small project using his or her ideas, and please friends who have the same direction or interest to criticize and corret. The data was run out on a small crew, it is not convenient to make it public. If you have any questions, welcome to communicate with me~
